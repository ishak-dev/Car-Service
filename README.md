# Files
In source (src) you will find folders (components, style, pages, assets...). Even evry in this folder is "self describing" we will go through each of them breafly.
Most important folder is "page". Every view and page is defined here, so we have:
- Admin - Classic Admin Dashboard
- Car History - Admin uses this page for reviewing car history (services, notes...)
- Cart - After user add some items in cart, all items will be displayed in Cart page
- Home - This is starting point of app
- Login - If user wants to buy he needs to be loged in
- Register - If user doesn't have a profile, there is register page
- Schedule - Usually user wants to know when to come to service garage, because of that we have schedule
- Shop - If user only wants to buy something from store, there is shop page
- It will be more soon...

Every page has its own component folder 
Also every page and component have their own style which is located in styles folder
